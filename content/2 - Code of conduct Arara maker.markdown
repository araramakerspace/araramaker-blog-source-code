# Code of conduct


# Finality



One of the objectives of all activities and user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive of the largest number of collaborators, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. 
As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all people, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or absence).


This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for everyone in our community, as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior.

We invite everyone who participates in our lab to help us create safe and positive experiences for all people.

To contribute to the academic and professional formation of the members through practical applications of the knowledge acquired during the graduation

To achieve its goals, the Arara-

* Develop programs and action plans to promote and execute projects

* Develop research to raise funds for laboratory creation



# Citizenship


A further goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase citizenship by encouraging participating people to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects in our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counterbalance the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making the extra effort to ensure that our community is welcoming, friendly and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest, we want to know.

#  Expected behavior


* Participate authentically and actively. By doing this, you contribute to the health and longevity of that community.

* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.

* Try to collaborate before starting conflicts.

* Refrain from humiliating, discriminatory or abusive behavior and communications.

* Be aware of your environment and other people present. Notify a person associated with the Arara maker if you notice a dangerous situation, someone being harmed, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem to you unimportant.

* Community event spaces can be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to everyone who is present at these locations.

# Unacceptable Behaviors


Unacceptable behaviors include, for example: intimidation, harassment, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or humiliating communications, actions by any participant in our online communities, in all related events and in individual communications performed in the context of Arara maker activities.

# Consequences of unacceptable behavior

If a person behaves unacceptably, members may take any action they deem appropriate, including temporary withdrawal (and no refund in case of a paid event).

After having ascertained the facts, the Council of Coordinating Members may even decide for the permanent expulsion of the offender.




# How to respond to a complaint


If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you must notify one of the persons associated with your version of the facts, which will be reviewed together with the original complaint.
